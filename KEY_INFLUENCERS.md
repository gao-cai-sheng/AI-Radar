## 7. Integration Strategy (How to use this list)

1.  **Repo Weighting**: If a GitHub repo is starred or created by these users (where applicable/public), `Impact Score += 50`.
2.  **Author Matching**: If an ArXiv paper has one of these names or **Institutions** as an author, `Credibility Score = MAX`.
3.  **Search Queries**: Periodically search `site:twitter.com [Name] "paper"` or `site:arxiv.org [Name]`.
